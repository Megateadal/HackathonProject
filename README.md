# HackathonProject - Incomplete

## Overview
Uses Python & Spotipy to inform users of the overall feeling (mood) of each indivudual playlist.

## Set-up
[Warning - currently incomplete so do not expect this to run correctly.] 

pip install requirements.txt

You would need to have created a developer profile on Spotify and substitute you CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET.
Currently the code will not run due to the user implementation not being finished. That is only if you create a developer account will this work.
